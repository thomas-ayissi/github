## Must-Haves

- Jane\*\*: As a recruiter working in an agency designing applications and
  websites, I want to be able to identify the soft skills of young developers so
  that I can easily integrate them into my database of potentially interesting
  profiles.

- Mansour\*\*: As a developer in training, I want to easily find condensed cheat
  sheets on programming languages. These cheat sheets allow me to learn
  programming languages quickly.

## Should-Haves

The website should have a home page like all websites. The site should also have
a menu and a footer because these elements are present in almost all websites.

## Could-Haves

## it would be interesting to have a login area on the site. Just to practice doing it.
