# Communication

## Group Rules

1. From our first meeting (Verousca and Thomas), we chose to work simultaneously
   on some parts of the work.
2. We also chose to work separately on some parts. These parts that we are
   working on separately are basically everything related to HTML and CSS.

## Asking for Help

We have not chosen to define specific hours for requests for assistance. The
idea of our group is that whenever one of us needs help, he or she simply
contacts the other.
