# User Personas

```markdown
## Jane : Recruiter

- **Bio** : Jane is a recruiter for a company whose business is application
  development and website design.

- **Needs/Goals**: Jane has a constant need to discover new talent. This allows
  her to have a stock of people she can contact to work for her company on a
  one-off or long-term basis.

- **Frustrations**: Many junior developers do not publish personal pages that
  identify their "soft skils", those human qualities that make all the
  difference when choosing between two candidates with almost identical skills.

- **Scenario ** : Jane should be allowed to get to know Verousca and Thomas by
  presenting both their work and giving an idea of their personalities (soft
  skills). A section should be included that includes these "soft skills".

## Mansour : Developer in training

- **Bio**: Mansour is learning programming.

- **Needs/Goals**: Mansour needs to better understand the world of coding and
  development. He appreciates websites that allow him to enrich his knowledge.

- **Frustrations**: there are many projects published on the web. But developers
  do not explain enough what the programming languages used can be used for and
  how to learn them easily and quickly.

- **Scenario**: Mansour should be able to find a section including summary
  sheets of the languages used. These cards will serve as a reminder to learn
  faster without drowning in resources.
